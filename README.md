1>Cat Photo App 

This is one of my very first HTML projects — a simple Cat Photo App built as part of
the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.
It’s a basic webpage that displays a cute cat photo using proper HTML structure like
`<!DOCTYPE>`, `html`, `head`, `body`, and image tags. The goal was to understand how
HTML elements work and how to structure a clean, semantic webpage.

2>What I learned:
- How to use basic HTML tags like `h1`, `p`, `img`, and `a`
- Writing clean and valid HTML5
- Adding alt text for accessibility
- Understanding the importance of semantic structure

 3>Why this project matters:
Everyone starts somewhere, and this is mine. It's a small step, but an important one
in my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer
